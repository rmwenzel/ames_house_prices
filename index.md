This project analyzes the [Ames housing data](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) and predicts the final sale price of houses
in that dataset. 

This is a learning project, based on the Kaggle Knowledge competition
[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) but the aim is to experience and document all steps in an end-to-end predictive modeling problem in great detail. 

Think of it as an overblown kernel ;)

The original dataset is available [here](http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.xls). A version of the dataset is available [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) - this is the dataset we'll be working with.

The project consists of three stages:

1. [Processing and cleaning]({{site.baseurl}}/process)
2. [Exploratory analysis]({{site.baseurl}}/explore)
3. [Predictive modeling]({{site.baseurl}}/model)


There's also a [repo](https://github.com/rmwenzel/ames_house_prices) with notebooks and code.
